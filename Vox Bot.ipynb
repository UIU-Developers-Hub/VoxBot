    "VoxBot is a Python-based AI assistant that seamlessly combines chat and voice interaction to create an intuitive and dynamic user experience. Through the ```OpenAI Chat Completion API```, users can engage in natural text-based conversations, while voice commands, powered by ```SpeechRecognition```, enable hands-free interactions. The interface, built using the ```Panel library```, provides a user-friendly platform for both modes.\n",

    "   - `button_chat`: A button widget labeled \"Chat!\".\n",
    "   - `button_voice`: A button widget labeled \"Voice!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It creates the `dashboard` layout by arranging the components vertically in a `pn.Column`:\n",
    "   - The text input widget (`inp`).\n",
    "   - A row containing the \"Chat!\" button (`button_chat`) and the \"Voice!\" button (`button_voice`).\n",
    "   - A panel with a spacer and a loading indicator, used to display chat and voice responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. It sets up the callbacks for button clicks:\n",
    "   - When the \"Chat!\" button is clicked, it calls the `chat_callback` function.\n",
    "   - When the \"Voice!\" button is clicked, it calls the `voice_callback` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. It defines a `chat_and_voice_callback` function that acts as a combined callback for both buttons. It checks the name of the event and calls the respective callback function (`chat_callback` or `voice_callback`).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. It creates a `response_panel` as a `pn.Column` to display chat and voice responses. This panel will be updated dynamically within the callback functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. It assigns the `chat_and_voice_callback` function to both buttons, so when either button is clicked, the combined callback is triggered.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. It creates the final layout (`final_layout`) by arranging the `dashboard` and `response_panel` vertically in a `pn.Column`.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. It uses the `servable()` method to display the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that the `chat_callback` and `voice_callback` functions and their associated logic are not described in the code snippet. You will need to define those functions separately to handle the chat and voice functionality within the application.\n"

       "OpenAI Response: Of course! Here are some tips to help you as a beginner Python programmer:</br>\n",
       "</br>\n",
       "1. Start with the basics: Begin by understanding the fundamentals of Python, such as variables, data types, loops, conditionals, and functions. These concepts form the building blocks of any Python program.</br>\n",
       "</br>\n",
       "2. Practice regularly: Consistent practice is key to improving your programming skills. Set aside dedicated time each day or week to work on coding exercises or small projects. This will help reinforce what you've learned and build your confidence.</br>\n",
       "</br>\n",
       "3. Utilize online resources: Take advantage of the numerous online tutorials, courses, and documentation available for Python. Websites like Codecademy, Coursera, and Python.org offer free or paid resources to help you learn and improve your Python skills.</br>\n",
       "</br>\n",
       "4. Join a community: Engage with other Python programmers by joining online forums, discussion groups, or attending local meetups. This will allow you to ask questions, seek advice, and learn from more experienced developers.</br>\n",
       "</br>\n",
       "5. Read and analyze code: Expose yourself to different Python code examples and try to understand how they work. Reading and analyzing code written by others will help you learn new techniques and improve your problem-solving abilities.</br>\n",
       "</br>\n",
       "6. Break down problems: When faced with a coding challenge or project, break it down into smaller, manageable tasks. This approach makes problem-solving more approachable and helps you tackle complex problems more effectively.</br>\n",
       "</br>\n",
       "7. Debugging skills: Debugging is an essential skill for any programmer. Learn how to use Python's debugging tools, like print statements or debuggers, to identify and fix errors in your code.</br>\n",
       "</br>\n",
       "8. Build projects: Apply your knowledge by working on small projects that interest you. Building projects allows you to practice what you've learned and gain practical experience in solving real-world problems.</br>\n",
       "</br>\n",

       "OpenAI Response: Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions and take actions in an environment in order to maximize a reward. It is similar to how humans learn through trial and error.</br>\n",
       "</br>\n",
       "In simpler terms, imagine you are in the third grade and your teacher wants you to learn how to solve math problems. Instead of giving you the answers directly, the teacher provides you with a set of math problems and rewards you when you solve them correctly. You learn through trial and error, trying different approaches and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.</br>\n",
       "</br>\n",
       "Similarly, in reinforcement learning, an agent interacts with an environment and receives feedback in the form of rewards or punishments based on its actions. The agent's goal is to learn the best actions to take in order to maximize the total cumulative reward over time.</br>\n",
       "</br>\n",
       "The agent explores the environment, tries different actions, and based on the rewards it receives, it learns which actions lead to better outcomes. Over time, through a process called trial and error, the agent becomes better at making decisions and taking actions that lead to higher rewards.</br>\n",
       "</br>\n",
       "Reinforcement learning has been successfully applied to various domains, such as robotics, game playing, and autonomous vehicles. It is a powerful approach that allows machines to learn and improve their decision-making abilities through interactions with the environment.</br>\n",
